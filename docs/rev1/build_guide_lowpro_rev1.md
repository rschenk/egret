# Egret Low-Pro Build Guide

## Required parts

### Parts for the case (laser cut)

The difference between the low-pro and the glow-pro model is the bottom plate(s). The top plate, top gasket, pcb, and bottom grip are the same between the two models. The lowpro model uses the lowpro bottom gasket, and the lowpro bottom plate.

The top and bottom plate are made from 1.5mm (1/16") acrylic and the top and bottom gasket are made from 0.7mm (1/32") silicone.

The bottom grip can be made from any sticky-back padded sheet, including silicone, epdm rubber, or eva foam. The bottom grip is somewhat optional. If you want to use the Egret only on your desk, then you can skip the bottom grip and just use the little silicone bumpers. However, for the lowest profile and the ability to use the keyboard directly on top of your laptop, I recommend the bottom grip layer.

Please note that *you cannot put LEDs on a Low-pro PCB,* otherwise the bottom case won't fit.

## PCB Assembly

Gotta start somewhere, lets do the power switch first. Put a small dot of solder on one of the pads on the board, place the reset switch, then heat that dot to tack it in place. Now with the switch tacked in place you can do the rest of the pads.

Next solder on all the hotswap sockets in a similar fashion.

Flip the board over and solder on all the diodes. Mind the direction.

Finally, solder on the JST connector, reset button, and headers for the MCU board.

## Case Assembly

Test fit the bottom plate onto the PCB. Due to the hotswap sockets not being symmetrical, there is an up and a down. The tolerances are somewhat tight, so check for any sloppy, blobby solder joints and make sure everything fits. Put a piece of masking tape, or dot with marker on the bottom side of the plate for the next two steps.

Remembering which side of the bottom plate faces down, counter sink all the screw holes on the underside. On the Low-Pro case, don't sink too deep, you want the screw heads to be flush or even *slightly* proud of the surface. To counter sink acrylic, I like the five-flute bits, use a low speed and light pressure and it will cut like butter.

Next apply the bottom grip to the bottom plate. The best way to do this is with a spray bottle of water with a small drop of soap. Spray a good mist of water onto the bottom plate, peel the backing paper off the grip adhesive, spray a good mist of water on the adhesive, then float the grip into place. More water is better than less. Once it's lined up, lightly squeegee the water out with an old credit card or similar. This technique is how people who do vinyl graphics get a perfect placement every time. Obviously do this before you put the bottom plate onto the PCB.

Once the bottom plate is completely dry from the above, place on the bottom gasket, bottom plate, and the four center holes that hold on the MCU cover plate. Tighten on the standoffs for the cover plate to tack everything together.

Next, place the top gasket and plate in place. Install all the bolts and nuts except for the two by your index finger homerow.

Pop in the switches on the index finger and inner column home- and top-row. There is a nut that nestles down between those switches but only goes in one way. Install that nut/bolt now. 

Install all the switches, MCU, and battery. Please be careful with the battery polarity, it is marked on the PCB with a small  `+`, and is the so-called standard (according to Adafruit) of the positive (red) wire on the left. 

Install the cover and you're good to go.

## Battery and Power

The battery connector polarity is marked on the PCB. The positive (red) wire should be on the left side of the connector.

The power slider switch goes to the right-hand side for on, left-hand side for off when viewed from the keys side of the board.
